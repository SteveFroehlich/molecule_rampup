# Introduction to Molecule 
This tutorial introduces the reader to molecule, the core concepts 
and has exercises of increasing complexity. The long term goal is 
to provide one possible road map to understanding and using molecule. 

## How to work through Examples
There are two ways to work through the exercises depending on the 
preference of the reader. Both paths have pre-written code to setup
an environment and run code written by the reader. The two options 
are:

1. [Github Actions](README_github_actions.md) this path requires forking
the repo and running github actions on your github account. It is free but
you don't have access to, or root on, the host running the code.

2. [AWS EC2](README_EC2.md) this path requires some familiarity with [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
It is not free (usually under a US dollar in cost) but gives more 
control and root access to the environment and host running the exercises.
