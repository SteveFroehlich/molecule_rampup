# Introduction to Molecule 
This tutorial show the reader how to do two specific tasks with
molecule. First is [exercise 1](workspace/exercise_1/README.md)
which demonstrates how to use molecule to make sure your role will 
execute and complete successfully. Second is [exercise 2](workspace/exercise_2/README.md)
which demonstrates how to add additional verifications that test
your role is doing what it should. This [video](https://youtu.be/iY4nnr-4tM4)
gives an overview of the exercises.

## How to work through Examples
There are two ways to work through the exercises depending on the 
preference of the reader. Both paths have pre-written code to setup
an environment and run code written by the reader. The two options 
are:

1. [Github Actions](README_github_actions.md) this path requires forking
the repo and running github actions on your github account. It is free but
you don't have access to, or root on, the host running the code.

2. [AWS EC2](README_EC2.md) this path requires some familiarity with [EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
It is not free (usually under a US dollar in cost) but gives more 
control and root access to the environment and host running the exercises.
