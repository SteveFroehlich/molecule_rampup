# Introduction to Molecule 
This document introduces the reader to molecule, the core concepts and has exercises of increasing complexity. It provides one possible road map to understanding and using molecule. 
### Assumptions
This document assumes the reader knows what [github actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
are and how to view the output of an action. 

# Molecule
This lesson will start with the basic walk through [here](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html#run-test-sequence-commands).
Which outlines the steps to get a simple example running.

Since you can learn most of the concepts from the documentation, this 
document provides instructions and exercises for tasks that molecule 
can help you do. For example test a simple role, add additional test 
coverage beyond what the role provides when executing and testing for
idempotence. 

To start take a look at the exercises under the workspace directory. 
A good place to start is with the simpliest one [here](workspace/exercise_1/README.md)
